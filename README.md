unzip awscli-bundle.zip
sudo ./awscli-bundle/install -i /usr/local/aws -b /usr/local/bin/aws

### Usage

Running the React Native application

#### Start Metro

Metro "takes in an entry file and various options, and returns a single JavaScript file that includes all your code and
its dependencies."
[â€”Metro Docs](https://facebook.github.io/metro/docs/concepts/)

```bash
npx react-native start
```

#### Start the application

Let Metro Bundler run in its own terminal. Open a new terminal inside your React Native project folder.

```bash
npx react-native run-ios
```
